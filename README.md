This project is a celular autamata model that simulates two groups of ants in an enviroment with food that follow a certain set of rules which are:

- the ants spawn on opposite sides of of the grid.
- each team of ants has a certain number of ants they start with.
- to gain more ants the ants must tranfer food to the center of the board on their side.
- each ant leaves a trace of scent behind them.
- when an ant is not carrying food it's movement is leaned towards the place with the least amount of scent (goes the opposite direction from it's nest).
- when an ant is carrying food it's movement is leaned towards the most amount of scent (goes back to it's nest).
- if an ant is in the neighborhod of food the ant will move to the square where the food is placed and take the food.
- if two ants are in the neighborhood of each other they will fight and there is a 50/50 percent chance that either ant will win. when an ant wins it moves to the square of the other ant and gains food (canibalism).

  this is not meant to be an accurate simulation but it is cool.
